title:  "Using GPU-enabled JupyterLab on the K8s home cluster"

My original plan for the home system started off fairly simple - I just wanted a machine with a GPU on it so that I could 
teach myself ML/DL - but as I got further into it, I realized I needed a more general-purpose development environment that was 
capable of doing distributed processing and running real ML pipelines, so I ended up with the three hypervisor/ESXi system running
HA Kubernetes. It allows me to quickly 'proof-of-concept' all sorts of projects and keep up with the latest technologies. Currently, for 
example, I'm building out some TFX/Kubeflow pipelines (blog post about that coming soon).

Early on I decided to use JupyterLab as my ML development environment of choice, but because now I was running on top of a hypervisor, some 
additional work had to be done to punch the GPU's through to the JupyterLAB pods ... but once you figure all that out, you end up with an awesome 
environment that looks like this:

Details to follow soon:

- creating GPU-enabled ESXi templates
- JupyterLAB 'docker stacks' - and how to modify them for use with GPUs
- details about docker stacks in general and how to modify jupyterLAB on k8s to support different environments:
