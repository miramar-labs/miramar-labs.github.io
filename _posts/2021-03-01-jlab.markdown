My original plan for the home system started off pretty simple - I just wanted a machine with a GPU on it so that I could 
teach myself ML/DL ... but of course things got out of hand quickly and I ended up with the three hypervisor/kubernetes system.
I wanted to use JupyterLab as my ML development environment, but because now I was running on top of a hypervisor, some additional work 
had to be done to punch the GPU's through to the JupyterLAB pods ... but once you figure all that out, you end up with an awesome 
environment that looks like this:

Details to follow soon:

- creating GPU-enabled ESXi templates
- JupyterLAB 'docker stacks' - and how to modify them for use with GPUs
- details about docker stacks in general and how to modify jupyterLAB on k8s to support different environments:
