In this age of COVID where everyone is working from home, what better way to spend your time than building your own dream 'Home Lab'?

This is my three-hypervisor ESXi system running HA Kubernetes (provisioned entirely from code using Terraform/Ansible)

I also have two NVIDIA GPU's available for training/inference tasks

See my [Github repo](https://github.com/miramar-labs/terraform-k8s) for details... !
